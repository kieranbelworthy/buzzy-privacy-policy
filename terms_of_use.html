Terms of Use

Scope of these terms
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Buzzy mobile/web application, website, related services, and any content or materials made available (collectively, the “Service”).

‘Buzzy’ is the name of a research-based pilot app created and operated by Kieran Belworthy and Cam Sharplin (the “Creators”). Buzzy is not a registered company or incorporated entity.

They incorporate and form one agreement with the following documents, each of which you can also agree to:
Privacy Policy: describes how we collect, use and protect your personal information.
Community Guidelines: one-page user friendly rules.
Code of Conduct: detailed behavioural standards and enforcement process.

If there is any conflict, these Terms prevail, followed by the Privacy Policy, Code of Conduct, and Community Guidelines (in that order).

2. Eligibility
2.1 Public Visitors (read-only access)
Anyone may access and view publicly available content on Buzzy (eg., Proposals, Topics, aggregated results) without creating an account.
Visitors must comply with Sections 5, 10 and 13.
Visitors may not post, vote, comment, or otherwise interact with the Service.
2.2 Registered Users (interactive access)
To post, vote, comment or create Proposals you must:
Be at least 16 years old; and
Register using an active @myvuw.ac.nz email address and complete two-factor authentication (6-digit code).
All provisions of these Terms apply in full to Registered Users.
Each person may register only one (1) account and must provide accurate information.

2.3 Future Releases - In future releases, additional or different eligibility terms may apply. You will be notified of any material changes.

3. Account Security & Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Mandatory 2FA - At sign up (and any subsequent login we designate), the Service will send a one-time 6 digit verification code to your VUW email address. You must enter that code in-app to complete authentication.
Purpose and Justification - 2FA protects you and other users by ensuring:
Only verified members of the VUW community can register;
Accounts cannot be accessed with a stolen password alone;
Research data integrity and participant confidentiality.
Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007 Compliance - Verification codes are transactional security emails, not commercial marketing messages, and therefore are exempt from the Act’s unsolicited electronic message restrictions.
Credentials Responsibility - You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and 2FA code. Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised access.
Breach Consequences - Failure to comply with security obligations may result in suspension or termination of your account.

4. Description of the Service and Research Nature
Pilot / Beta Status - Buzzy is an experimental democracy platform in pilot. Features may change, be suspended, or be discontinued without notice.
Core functions - Users can:
Create Proposals (suggested actions or policy changes);
Support, discuss, or critique Proposals;
Vote on community-promoted Topics (two-week referendum-style questions);
View aggregated results and statistics.
Research Purpose - All user activity and content are collected and analysed for academic research. Findings will be reported only in aggregate or anonymised form. No personally identifiable information (PII) will appear in publications.
No Professional Advice - Content on the Service is user-generated and provided for discussion. It does not constitute professional, legal, or policy advice from VUW.
Public Visibility - Certain portions of Buzzy are publicly viewable without an account; including browsing current Proposals, seeing Topic questions, and viewing historical voting results. Interactive functionality (posting Proposals, commenting, voting, supporting, etc.) requires registration as set out in Section 2.2.

5 User Content
Definition - “User Content” means any text, graphics, data or other material you submit, post or otherwise make available via the Service (including Proposals, comments and votes).
Your Responsibility - You are solely responsible for your User Content and must ensure it complies with the Code of Conduct and applicable law.
Licence to Buzzy - By submitting User Content you grant the Creators (operating the Buzzy service) a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to:
Host, reproduce, display and distribute the content within the Service;
Process, analyse and adapt it in anonymised or aggregated form for research, educational, and publication purposes.
This licence terminates when you delete your content or account except to the extent the content has been anonymised or included in aggregate datasets that cannot reasonably be altered.
Moral Rights Waiver - To the extent permitted by law, you waive any moral rights in User Content as necessary for the above licence.

6 Community Behaviour
You must at all times follow the Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct (collectively, the “Rules”). Breaches may result in content removal, warnings, suspension, or permanent ban, as described in the Code of Conduct.

7 Privacy and Data Handling
Privacy Policy Incorporated - The Privacy Policy forms part of these Terms. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described there, including:
Collection of registration details, demographic information (optional), device/usage analytics, and User Content;
Mandatory 2FA email for account security;
Storage on Heroku (EU) and MongoDB Atlas (AU) with protections comparable to NZ law;
Retention until account deletion or data deletion on 1 December 2026;
Research use solely in aggregate/anonymised form.
Withdrawal - You may delete your account at any time in-app or by contacting us. Post-withdrawal handling of data is explained in the Privacy Policy.
Research Consent - Your acceptance of these Terms confirms you have read the Privacy Policy and understand that your (anonymised) data will contribute to academic research outputs.

8 Notifications and Communications
In-App Notifications - Buzzy provides activity alerts and platform updates only through in-app notifications or push messages. You may adjust or mute these  notifications in your device’s settings at any time.
Email Communications - Apart from 2FA codes and essential account correspondence that you request (eg. password reset), Buzzy will not send promotional or unrelated emails without your express opt-in, ensuring compliance with the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007.
Contract Details - You consent to us using your registered VUW email to fulfill security-related or legally required communications.

9 Intellectual Property (Platform)
Ownership - All software, source code, design, graphics, trademarks (including “Buzzy”), and other materials that constitute or are displayed by the Service (collectively, “Buzzy IP”) are and shall remain the exclusive property of The Creators.
Licence to You - Subject to these Terms, The Creators grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable licence to access and use the Service for its intended, non-commercial, research-related purposes.
Restrictions - You may not:
Copy, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, or distribute any Buzzy IP, except that you may capture and publicly share screenshots or short video clips of the Service for non-commercial, personal or journalistic purposes, provided you do not alter the Buzzy logo or otherwise misrepresent the Service;
Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any parts of the Service;
Remove copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices.
Feedback - If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, royalty free licence to use and incorporate them without obligation or compensation to you.

10 Disclaimers
Service “As Is” - The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis for research. We make no warranties (express or implied) regarding availability, accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
User Content - We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of User Content. Any reliance is at your own risk.
Limitation of Liability - To the extent permitted by New Zealand law, Buzzy’s total liability to you arising out of or relating to the Service is limited to NZ $100.

Indemnity - You agree to indemnify us against losses or claims arising from your breach of these Terms or violation of law.

11 Termination
By You - You may terminate these Terms at any time by deleting your account. Termination ends your right to use interactive features or any authenticated access. You may continue to browse publicly available content as a Visitor, subject to Sections 5, 10, and 13.
By The Creators - We may suspend or terminate your account immediately for breach of these Terms or the Rules, or if required by law or ethics obligations.
Effect - Upon termination, your right to access the Service in any capacity other than as a Visitor ceases. Sections that by nature should survive (eg. licences, disclaimers, liability limits) remain in effect.

12 Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes via in-app notice or email (where appropriate). Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service and delete your account.

13 Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms and any dispute arising from them are governed by the laws of New Zealand. You and the Creators of Buzzy submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Wellington, New Zealand.
