Buzzy: Digital Democracy at VUW

PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET FOR PARTICIPANTS

Kia ora,

Buzzy is a new app for Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) students to propose, discuss, and vote on ideas relevant to them and their community. Students are also invited to discuss opportunities to enhance wellbeing throughout wider society.

This pilot project will test whether Buzzy can be used to surface actionable, consensus-based ideas for change sourced from VUW students. Findings will be used to help improve the ease of use and functionality of Buzzy ahead of an intended app store release. They will also inform research on deliberative democratic practices among students conducted by Dr. Luke Oldfield.

Please read the information below before deciding whether or not to participate.

Who are we?

Buzzy is developed and operated by Kieran Belworthy and Cam Sharplin, a pair of recent graduates living in Wellington. Led by Dr. Luke Oldfield, this research enables exploration of innovative new ways of enhancing democracy in Aotearoa New Zealand.

What is the aim of the project?

This project aims to investigate how students at VUW engage with the research prototype version of Buzzy. We want to understand your experiences using the app, identify any benefits or challenges that arise from its use, and gain insights into how digital technology can be used to facilitate deliberative democracy in a closed-circuit environment.

This research has been approved by the Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington Human Ethics Committee [HE040475].

How can you help?

You have been invited to participate in this pilot test because you are a current student at VUW. If you agree to take part, you will be asked to download Buzzy through the link provided and create an account. You can best help us by engaging with the app’s various features, and sharing your experience and feedback with us through the app. Feedback will also be requested of Buzzy users via email at the end of the trimester.


What will happen to the information you give?

This research is confidential. This means that the researchers (the Principal Investigator and the Buzzy team) will know what information you contributed, but your name and other personal identifiers will be kept separate from the research data. The data from all participants will be combined, and your identity will not be revealed in any public form. Please be aware that because participation in this study is limited to VUW students, there is a small chance someone who knows you might guess your involvement based on what you choose to share. We will also minimise this risk by not including any obvious identifying details in our reports.

All data collected from the app (such as responses or usage logs) will be stored securely on a cloud-based server with password protection. Only the Buzzy team will have access to the identifiable data. We are using secure cloud services that meet the university’s data security requirements to store your information. No one outside the research team will be able to view the raw data through which you could be identified.

During the project, your data will be stored in identifiable form (linked to your account identifier) so that we can manage your participation. We will destroy all information created through the system on 1 December 2026. No data collected during the pilot will be used in a future app store release of Buzzy, or for any other purpose beyond the research aims stipulated.

What will the project produce?

The project will produce insight into whether Buzzy can surface actionable, consensus-based ideas from a democratic community, namely VUW students.

The data outputs created by the pilot may be used by Dr. Luke Oldfield for academic research and publishing purposes.

A summary of research outputs will be sent to all participants after the conclusion of the pilot.

If you accept this invitation, what are your rights as a research participant?

You do not have to accept this invitation if you don’t want to. If you decide to participate, you have the right to:
Decline to interact with any part of the app you do not want to.
Withdraw from the research anytime before the end of Trimester 2, 2025, without having to give a reason. If you withdraw, the information you have provided will be removed and not included in the research.
Ask questions about the research at any time.
Request access to your data: you can ask to see any information you have provided during the study and request a copy of your contributions.
Be assured of confidentiality: your name will not be used in any reports, and nothing could personally identify you will be disclosed in any publications from this research.
